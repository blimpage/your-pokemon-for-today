# Your Pokémon for Today

This is a nice little gallery site showing off the rad [Your Pokémon for Today](http://midnitesurprise.com/tagged/yourpokemonfortoday) illustrations that the rad [KC Green](http://kcgreendotcom.com/) has been posting on his Twitter and Tumblrs.

It doesn't really need to exist, and yet it does!!

It uses [Swipebox](https://github.com/brutaldesign/swipebox) for lightboxy stuff, [Lazy Load](https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload) to mitigate the loading of 700+ images, and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for basic styling.
